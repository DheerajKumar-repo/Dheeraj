## 🚀 Professional Summary

I’m passionate about developing **AI-driven vision systems** that can detect, analyze, and understand real-world equipment — including GPS units, cables, signboards, and industrial components.

My goal is to create solutions that:
- Automate **field validation and inspection**
- Improve **accuracy and operational efficiency**
- Transform **raw images into intelligent insights**

Each project I build focuses on bridging the gap between **human observation and machine intelligence**, making technology more **assistive, scalable, and reliable** for industries like telecom, infrastructure, and automation.
